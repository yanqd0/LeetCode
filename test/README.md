# Test Cases

In [generators](./generators), any file except [utils.py](./generators/utils.py) stands for a problem.
Excute them with update csv files in [cases](./cases).

It is easy to add or update a series of test cases with a python generator.
See any of them, like [two_sum.py](./generators/two_sum.py), as a demo.
