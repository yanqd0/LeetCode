## Philosophy

I play LeetCode to learn not only algorithms, but also languages.

There are several sub projects, which sharing the same [test cases](./test).

Sub projects:

- [Python](./python)
- [Java](./java)
- [JavaScript](./javascript)

With shared test cases, it is easy to write different language solution for the same problem.

## Something Good

There are 2 things are valuable in this toy project.

- The project structure with a build framework.
- The test code which using a csv based cases.
