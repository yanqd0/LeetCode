There is a gradle wrapper in the project, so only Java 1.8 (or above) is really a necessary prerequisite.
Some other dependencies is handled by Gradle.

## Setup

If an IntelliJ is used, then import this directory as a project.
You need just click, click and click in the UI.

If an code editor are used, you may need to setup the development environment in a terminal.

```sh
./gradlew build
```

## Develop

Add new solutions as classes in `src/main/java`, and their tests in `src/test/java`.

Don't forget to change package name.

## Test

```sh
./gradlew test
```
